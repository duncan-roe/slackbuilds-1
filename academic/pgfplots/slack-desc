# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pgfplots:
pgfplots: PGFPlots draws high-quality function plots in normal or logarithmic
pgfplots: scaling with a user-friendly interface directly in TeX. The user
pgfplots: supplies axis labels, legend entries and the plot coordinates for one
pgfplots: or more plots and PGFPlots applies axis scaling, computes any
pgfplots: logarithms and axis ticks and draws the plots, supporting line plots,
pgfplots: scatter plots, piecewise constant plots, bar plots, area plots, mesh--
pgfplots: and surface plots and some more.
