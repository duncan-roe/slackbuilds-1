xv has been a part of Slackware since at least Slackware1.2 (I have the
Trans-Ameritech CD to prove it!). xv is missing from Slackware15.0 though,
perhaps because it no longer builds. I got it to build again with a 1-line
patch, so here it is.
The version (3.10a) is not negotiable!
The SB follows what Pat used to do: download 3.10 and patch to 3.10a.
You *can* get a 3.10a tarball from the home page but the resulting directory is
*different* from what you get by patching.
(Specifically a couple of .ps files differ: gv can't display either version of
either of them).
With that in mind, I have played safe by fetching everything from Slackware14.2.
I tried to buy an xv licence since the home page says they take credit cards,
but got the message "This product is inactive and no longer for sale".
Was going to put that in slack-desc but didn't.
When choosing whether to keep a line the same as Pat's script or make it the
same as autotools-template, I opted for Pat's script.
