xssstate
------------------------------------

This is the xssstate utility from suckless.org.

This tool is a simple tool that retrieves the X screensaver state.
This can be used in scripts that can start screen lockers, or
other utilities.

The screensaver states include the idle time, the screensaver state,
and the time how long to wait until the screensaver should be active.

The values for the screensaver states in X can be changed using
xset(1).

Turn off the screensaver:

  % xset s 0
  % xset s 0ff

Turn on the screensaver after 60 seconds inactivity:

  % xset s 60

Force the screensaver to be active:

  % xset s blank
