Winff will now use the users default pdf viewer using
xdg-open also added support for Okular pdf reader. It will
now use the -O2 optimization and added some hardening flags
to the linker and fix wrongly escaped single quote in the
man page.I've added these patches from Debian Maintainer
Paul Gevers.

Removed the hint that said TEST in the lower left side corner
of the GUI,when you hover the mouse in the area between the
convert button and options button.Fixed the Dialog boxes under
the Ffmpeg tab were it will now show pass 1 and pass 2 separately
previously the pass 1 dialog was merged with the top parameter
dialog box.Put Underscore between the "Cancel Changes",
"Apply Changes" and "Apply to All" buttons and will now be
further apart for clarity. From FFmpeg versions 5 and later
the -vol command will fail.For example -vol 512 has been changed
to -filter:a "volume=1.5", since slackware uses FFmpeg4
this is not a problem for now.Added Hints to the 2 buttons
next to the folder path.The open  was not working due to
older lazarus not passing commands updating to Lazarus 2.2.2-0
will solve that problem.If you cross compile winff for windows
without patching the language files it will show the old links.
Thanks to David Miller for patches,Improvments and testing Winff.

Created a set of patches instead of sed commands.

Extended the Copyright, which previously was upto the year 2016.

GTK2 has reached end of life also GTK3 widget set support in
lazarus is in alpha stage in lazarus.See the following post
for details.

As such it no longer make sense to default to GTK.We will
now default to qt5 nstead of GTK.Therefore libqtpas is now a
dependency. Install libqtpas before installing lazarus.

Removed a Dangling link to AV GNU/Linux Distro.

If for Some reason "Cancel changes","Apply to all" and
"Apply changes" button does not appear do not fret, Enter the
Values you need to modify in Video/Audio/Crop/Time and then
add the file to convert it would pass the options.You can check
the Command in the FFmpeg tab. This is a workaround.

Patched the manpage to show the winff docmentation location
in slackware.

This build removes all other localization files except english
since it contains outdated links and may pose security risk.
Bumped the build no.
